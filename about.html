      <h2>Hey, I'm Joy Katanu Kyalo ‚òï</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Tea & Thoughts</strong>, my little corner of the
        internet where I share my love for tea, mindfulness, and personal
        growth. This space is more than just a website‚Äîit‚Äôs a reflection of my
        journey, my passions, and my desire to create a community where we can
        all find peace and inspiration.
      </p>

      <h3>My Story üåø</h3>
      <p>
        Growing up in Kenya, tea was always a big part of my life. From the
        early morning chai shared with family to the quiet moments spent sipping
        tea while watching the sunset, it became a symbol of warmth, connection,
        and reflection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Life hasn‚Äôt always been easy. There were times when I felt overwhelmed,
        lost, and disconnected from myself. During those moments, I turned to
        tea and mindfulness practices as a way to heal and find clarity. That‚Äôs
        how <strong>Tea & Thoughts</strong> was born‚Äîa space to share what I‚Äôve
        learned and to help others find their own moments of peace.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Tea? üçµ</h3>
      <p>
        For me, tea is more than just a drink, it‚Äôs a ritual. It‚Äôs about slowing
        down, being present, and savoring the moment. My absolute favorite tea
        is <strong>hibiscus</strong>. Its vibrant color and tangy flavor always
        brighten my day, and I love how it‚Äôs packed with antioxidants. Whether
        it‚Äôs a hot cup on a rainy day or a chilled glass in the summer, hibiscus
        tea is my go-to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tea also has a unique way of bringing people together. Some of my most
        meaningful conversations have happened over a shared pot of tea. It‚Äôs a
        universal language of comfort and connection.
      </p>

      <h3>The Power of Mindfulness üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h3>
      <p>
        Mindfulness has been a game-changer for me. It‚Äôs not about eliminating
        stress or avoiding challenges, it‚Äôs about learning to navigate life with
        grace and intention. Through meditation, journaling, and mindful
        breathing, I‚Äôve discovered how to create moments of calm even in the
        busiest of days.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this website, I share some of the practices that have helped me, from
        guided meditations to journaling prompts. My hope is that they‚Äôll
        inspire you to create your own mindfulness rituals.
      </p>

      <h3>A Community of Growth üå±</h3>
      <p>
        What started as a personal project has grown into a beautiful community.
        I‚Äôm constantly inspired by the stories and experiences shared by people
        who visit <strong>Tea & Thoughts</strong>. Together, we‚Äôre creating a
        space where we can sip, reflect, and grow.
      </p>
      <p>

        mindfulness tips, or just to take a moment for yourself, I‚Äôm so glad
        you‚Äôre part of this journey.
